        <span class="blog-subtitle"><p><em>Core Blog Post &#8211; 19 January, 2023</em></p></span>
        <ol>
          <li><p><strong>What is my long term goal or career pathway?</strong><br>
          Simply put, I want to become a developer. I don’t know exactly what I expect this to look like, but I presume I’ll graduate and get a job in a dev team – hopefully somewhere that will help me continue my learning. Then I’ll start to think about where I want to specialise. Things like AI and Cyber Security are of interest to me – but we will see!</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>My strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</strong><br>
          My biggest strength when it comes to learning is that I love learning! I am in my element when I’m getting new, interesting information thrown at me which suits me really well to this sort of environment. I also love problem solving – which is a big part of why I want to be a developer too. I think this sets me up well to make the most of the Dev Academy experience and not get too overwhelmed. </p>
          <p>I also like to share and help others with their learning which generally helps me to solidify my own understanding. That is a feature of the course that has been emphasised by the facilitators so far, so I’m excited to embrace this as we get into bootcamp etc. </p>
          <p>My biggest limitations will be focus and time management. I suffer from what I call “magpie syndrome” where I tend to get fixed on shiny, exciting things and can loose sight of what I am supposed to be doing. This can lead me down a rabbit hole easily and by the time I realise I’ve gotten off track, I can easily be a couple of hours behind where I was meant to be. </p>
          <p>The timeboxing, and building up the habit of time-tracking will definitely help with this and I’ll need to make sure I stay mindful about what I am spending my time on as the workload increases. </p>
          <li><p><strong>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would I like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy?</strong></p>
          <p>I have often found myself in quite an isolated role in jobs that I’ve had in the past. I love solving problems and helping people out, but this isn’t often a collaborative process and I feel a bit of FOMO for the productivity and solutions that would be possible when I can actually work in a team to get something done. </p>
          <p>I think that this is a skill I am not very proficient with and would like to develop further. The ability to connect with a group, break down a problem together and then divide and conquer the work to get it done – rather than being a one-man-army who has to solve everything myself. </p>
          <li><p><strong>My commitment to managing my workload. </strong><br>
          I know this course is going to be hard work and I want to make sure that I can get the most out of my time here. To make sure I’m on peak form, I am committing to the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Self-care: I know the routines and activities that I need to do in order to feel good and function well. I won’t let these slip during the course so that I’m bringing my best self to the keyboard each day. 
            </li>
            <li>Work smarter not harder: I’m chronic for getting stuck for way too long when something isn’t working, so I’m going to try to offset this by trying to be the person who watches out for roadblocks when I’m working – both individually and in groups. This way I believe I can find a better balance and make sure we ask for help or take a break when we get stuck.
          </li>
          <li>Being honest: I’ve tried to start as I intend to continue with the foundations reflections by being as honest and open as possible. I will resist the urge to put on a brave face when things are feeling tough and hope that this will create a safe space for my classmates to share in the same way. 
          </li>
          <li>I will approach every interaction with empathy and kindness. We’re all learning and we’re all here to support each other. There’s no room for negativity or harsh words. 
          </li>
          <li>I will bring the laughter. My humour might be 90% puns and obscure pop-culture references from 10 years ago, but damnit, I’m gonna embrace it and hope that it helps to keep things fun. 
          </li>
          <li>Finally, when I’m overwhelmed or feeling the pressure I’ll ask for help. From my homegroup or the staff or from my personally support network. I won’t struggle in silence. 
          </li> <br>
        </ul>
      </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way</strong></p><br>
          <ul>
          <li>As soon as I realise I’m stuck on something, I’m going to set a timer for 5 minutes. If I can’t sort it myself in
            that time, that’s my cue to ask for help. </li>
          <li>
            I’ll start with the open channels on discord, to see if there’s some knowledge sharing that can help and/or so that
            others can see the question and maybe learn from it too. </li>
          <li>
            I’ll keep it direct (a challenge for me at times) and try to give only the context that is required to understand
            the problem. </li>
          <li>
            If I have been stuck for a while, then it’s probably a good time to take a screen break, grab a drink and some puppy
            cuddles and wait to see if anyone has any idea. </li>
          <li>
            If I don’t hear straight away, I won’t let it keep me from moving forward. If I can move onto something else, I will
            or if not I will either ping the facilitators and/or continue looking for a solution myself. 
          </li><br> 
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>A description of what I expect from the Facilitation team</strong><br>
            I expect support and kindness from the facilitation team, to take a ‘no dumb questions’ approach to what will
            inevitably be my dumb questions. I also expect them to challenge me if I’m not meeting the expectations of the
            course, and tell me if I’m getting on the wrong track. </p>
        <p>I also expect them to laugh at my jokes. Not in like a “they must laugh” kind of way, more like, they will just
          find them so fun that it is my assumption that they will laugh.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you
                might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</strong></p>
            <p>All of my commitments are outside of the bootcamp hours so there shouldn’t be issues there. However, I am very much a morning person and I don’t really function after 10pm. With the exception of late night flurries of coding to get a project finished with my team, I’ll intend to do any extra work in the morning from 5am when my brain is fresh and will try to defend my evenings as wind-down and recharge time as much as possible. </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

        <span class="blog-subtitle"><p><em>Tech Blog Post &#8211; 19 January, 2023</em></p></span>
        <p><strong>Sometimes it can seem like elements on a webpage have a mind of their own. You know that it <em>should</em> be possible to make a div go to a certain spot, or to make an image line up with a heading. You’ve seen websites where this happens. You’ve maybe even done it yourself by chance now and then. But gettng it to work on demand? Well that’s a different story. </strong></p>

<p>A lot of the time (not always, mind you), these challenges can be met headon with a solid understanding of the ‘position’ attribute, and today we’re going to dive into exactly how it works and how you can use it to make some pretty lil’ pages.<p>

<p>Before we start, a quick practical note about how to edit the actual position of each of these elements. Along with setting the position attribute for an element, you can also set values for top, bottom, left and right. The default settings for this are top: 0; left: 0; and can be set to numeric values just like any other CSS attribute. This will make more sense soon, but this guide would be incomplete without this note. Enough said – on with the post!</p>
<h3>Position: Static</h3>
<p>So first, what exactly is the position attribute doing when no-one is looking?</p>
<p>In simple terms, the position attribute tells the browser where to put and element within the document when it loads. By default, position is set to ‘static’. You might be led to believe that static means unmoving, which could lead you astray pretty quickly!</p>

<p>Much like the latest teen high-school drama to appear on Netflix, the position attribute is all about relationships. The browser needs a point of reference to position the element in relation to, and that is where the different options come in when we’re setting our position attribute in CSS. So it’s important to remember that by default, the term ‘static’ means static within the flow of the document. It’s kind of like a queue at the grocery store, and the static position is the internet version of ‘no cutsies!’ The element will remain in it’s place between the two elements that are before and after it in the HTML document. </p>
<br>
<h3>Position: Relative</h3>
<p>But what if you want to make something that looks more like a webpage and less like a poorly formatted university assignment? Well, this is where the fun begins as we start to branch out with our position types.</p>

<p> We’re going to continue with the teen drama analogy because it kinda works quite well for this blog (and it’s just super fun and relatable, right?)</p>
<p>The relative position tells the browser where to place the element in relation to where it would naturally appear in the flow of the document (i.e. relative to it’s default ‘static’ position). If the static position is our main character, then the relative position is their best friend and supporting lead. They’re the one always found two steps behind and to the left of the main character as they walk dramatically down the hallway.</p>
<div style="display: flex; position: static;">
  <div style="margin: 10px;">
    <div style="background-color: orange;position:static;height:100px;width: 200px;text-align:center;margin-top: 0;"><p style="padding-top:40px;">position: static</p></div>
    <div style="background-color: blue;position:static;height:100px;width: 200px;color:#fff;text-align:center;margin-top: 0;"><p style="padding-top:40px;">position: static</p></div>
  </div>
  <div style="margin: 10px;">
    <div style="background-color: orange;position:static;height:100px;width: 200px;text-align:center;"><p style="padding-top:40px;">position: static</p></div>
    <div style="background-color: blue;position:relative;opacity: 50%;color:#fff;top:-100px;height:100px;width: 200px;text-align:center;"><p style="padding-top:40px;">position: relative;<br>top: -100px;</p></div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>With the relative position you get to be the director, telling your supporting cast where they should be standing in relation to the main character. This can be a fickle approach, especially on dynamic or responsive webpages as it could change as other elements on the page change.</p>
<p>That said, it’s useful for creating a relationship between two elements in a relatively isolated part of your page. For example, maybe you have two divs that are 100px tall each and stacked on top of each other within another div. You could set reduce the opacity of the second element and set position: relative with a value of top: -100px. This would create a transparent overlay for whatever is in the first div that would remain in place so long as those divs stay close together.</p>
<br>
<h3>Position: Fixed</h3>
<p>Okay, so that makes sense. But what about if you want to buck the trend, stand on your own, and get out of the flow of society, *ahem* I mean, the DOM? Well in the words of modern day high schoolers, I got you fam. Let’s talk about the fixed position property.</p>
<div class="fixed-element" style="background-color: orange;position:fixed;height:100px;width: 200px;text-align:center;top: 40%;right: 10px;"><p style="padding:10px 5px;">I am a fixed element. Read more to learn how I work.</p></div>
<div class="pac-man"><img src="../public/img/800px-Pac_Man.svg.png" alt=""><p>Nom nom nom. My z-index is 2 so I'm going to eat this div!</p></div>
<p>In websites, as in high school, it’s all about how people see you and you can’t show that you’re unique unless there’s a common world view (or viewport) to compare youself to, right? That’s kind of how the fixed property functions. It takes an element out of the flow of the document and positions it in relation to the view port based using the position you provide in your stylesheet.</p>

<p>Because this approach position is completely separated from the rest of the page, it will stay in place when the user scrolls, appearing to slide over the rest of the content, as if it is floating. You will have seen this commonly for pop-ups on websites that stay in place even when you try to scroll away. Beware the dreaded z-index however! It’s usually best to put the code for your fixed element at the end of the document to prevent it from playing hide and seek behind other elements on the page!</p>
<br>
<h3>Position: Absolute</h3>
<p>Last but not least, we have the absolute position which is perhaps the most complicated of the three attributes we’re discussing today. Not disimilar from our teen drama characters, the absolute position represents that absolute authority of parents to decide our fate – or something like that.</p>

<p>Elements with the absolute position are displayed by the browser in relation to their closest positioned ancestor. In other words, the browser looks at the browser looks at the other elements that the positioned element is nested within until it finds one with a position set in the stylesheets. When it finds one, it works similar to the relative position, using the location settings to display the element in relation to the position of that parent element.</p>

<p>This can get confusing as it may not always be obvious which parent element is being used as the point of reference. What’s more, if the browser can’t find a positioned parent, it will default to using the document body, which can make it look like it is being positioned relative to the viewport (which it definitely isn’t).</p>

<p>Using the absolute position is much like our titular teen protagonist getting grounded for going to that party they shouldn’t have attended. The parent wants to keep the child close to make sure they can’t get into any mischief. And to extend the anology, if the parent isn’t there to intervene, then all hell breaks loose and the child is on their own.</p>

<p>Just bacause it’s a touch complex, doesn’t mean it isn’t a useful property however. A great usecase would be positioning some text, like a title or caption over an image. Just make sure you test it at different screen sizes to make sure you stay colouring between the lines.</p>
<div style="position: relative">
  <p><em>Can we position a caption over top of this here image?</em></p>
  <img style="width: 100%;" src="../public/img/adi-goldstein-Hli3R6LKibo-unsplash.jpg" alt="">
  <div style="width: 100%; position: absolute;bottom:0;background-color:#696969;color:#fff;padding-top: 5px;text-align:center;opacity: 75%;"><p>We <em>absolutely</em> can do that ;)</p></div>
</div>
<br>
<p>So today we’ve learned two key things. First, we now know that a fictional American high school has much more in common with HTML than it would appear on the surface. Second we now have a good summary of what the three main position attributes do, and how they work. Now, the best thing you can do is go and try it for yourself and if you get stuck, take a break to watch some Netflix as revision. </p>
