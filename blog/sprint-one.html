        <p><strong>At an old job of mine, there was a parking lot across the street run by the scourge-of-the-earth company Wilson Parking. I would park there from time to time when I needed a car after work for one reason or another. One day, I parked there and forgot to pay for my early bird parking. After work, I come out to find a ticket for $65 tucked under my windscreen for a breach in the parking lot’s terms and conditions. Cue the ethical dilemma. </strong></p>

        <p>On the one hand, I made an honest mistake and in fairness the terms and conditions do state that they can issue a fine for breaching the contract that I ‘agreed’ to when I entered the carpark and parked my car. On the other hand, I was pretty hard up for money at the time, and I had recently read an article which pointed out that any fine for breach of contract must be reasonable and proportionate to the cost that the breach caused the company. </p>
        
        <p>So, I decided that I would play the game and see how it went. I found the bank account on the ticket and deposited around $22 into the account – the cost of the day’s parking and an extra $5 or so. I then emailed Wilson carparking and explained the situation, stating that I had paid the $22 into their account to cover the day’s parking, and an additional $5 to cover reasonable enforcement costs. I concluded the email saying that I considered the matter settled in full. </p>
        
        <p>Their response was fairly generic. Something to the tune of: this matter isn’t settled, you need to pay the full amount by the due date. Excellent. But I was down the rabbit hole now, so turning back wasn’t an option. I responded with two things. The first was to remind them that their fine can only constitute compensation for lost revenue and the impact of the breach on their business. I then asked for an itemised list of the costs of enforcement that my lack of paying caused. I advised that if they can demonstrate that $65 is reasonable compensation for the breach, then I would be happy to pay. </p>
        
        <p>I never heard from them again and so far no debt collectors have turned up at my door. </p>
        
        <p>I chose that story becuse I think it speaks to the subjective nature of ethics and values in real life, and how it can be extremely difficult to operate with a clear moral code in a world that is often reprehensible. </p>
        
        <p>Obviously, I was in the wrong. But in a legal sense, I found myself in a legal conflict with an organisation with far more resources than me over a contract to which my ‘agreement’ was dubious at best. If a company rented a set of car parks from Wilson and they got a few days, or even weeks behind on their invoices, you can bet that they would follow up an allow them to pay the outstanding invoices before they took away the service they we’re offering. There wouldn’t be penalties for missing the payment deadline by a couple of hours, that’s for sure. But becuase I am an individual they can set unreasonable terms and I have to endure it, or fear that the repurcussions are going to somehow ruin my life. </p>
        
        <p>The whole cost of parking polava is sure to get most folks red around the collar, with the idea that renting out 7m2 worth of land for upwards of $19 a day is just wrong. I was raised in a very white, middle-class, christian family and (aside from some of the more problematic views that I’ve had to deconstruct from that environment) one of the core tenats of my moral code is to care for those who are less fortunate than yourself. Companies that gouge people for hundreds of dollars to access and essential service are the antithesis of this point of view. </p>
        
        <p>People over power. That’s how I would summarise my decision in that story and it’s also a good summation of the way I try to live my life. Few things get me more riled up than someone in power taking advantage of those who are subject to them. It has been a challenge working in marketing and sales for the last few years as I have always felt like I was complicit in exactly the sort of exploitation that I so despised. </p>
        
        <p>As part of this reflection I completed the 16 Personalities assessment. My result was the “Advocate” which aligns pretty well with this theme of watching out for those around me. A feature of this personality type is having a tendency towards idealism, and having a strong view about how the world should be. I can easily trace this to my upbringing where my worldview was largely dictated by a certain, very old, very controversial book (that we won’t dicuss in detail here). </p>
        
        <p>Having such a clear set of rules for morality, however skewed that perspective may have been on certain issues, suited me well and helped me to ground myself in a solid view of how things are and should be. Even now, I find that I tend towards a fairly black and white view of the world – even if the values that I hold have become more liberal and fluid as I have grown. Part of my journey has been accepting that the world is very grey and that there is often more than one “right” perspective – even if that sometimes makes me uncomfortable. </p>
        
        <p>The other source that I revisited in this process was my Gallup Strength Finder results which I completed in the middle of last year. I have done a few of these strength assessments over the years and the top themes have stayed mostly consistent each time. The top theme is ususally some form of problem solving. I’m the sort of person who get’s excited about things going wrong, as long as I am in a position to help fix the issue. I thrive on the challenge and the satisfaction of taking something that doesn’t work well and making it work. </p>
        
        <p>This almost always combines with being a lover of learning, and I am always seeking out new skills and hobbies. I like to learn things simply to collect the information and there’s no rhyme or reason to things I find fascinating at times. The other theme that remains constant is a tendency towards helping others, and helping them succeed even if at the detriment of my own success. This was represented in the strength finders as well as the 16 Personalities assessment. I believe this trait is why I have done well in a communications and marketing role, as I am patient with others who are learning or trying to solve a problem, and I’m generally good at ingesting new information, making sense of it and then communicating it in simple terms. </p>
        
        <p>I think that this combination of traits makes Dev Academy the perfect place for me to learn. The focus on practical learning with challenges will get the problem solving gears turning in my head and the collaborative and peer-supported environment will put me in my element. I love working alongside others who want to learn just as much as me and I think that I will thrive in sharing understanding with my classmates as we fill the gaps in each other’s knowledge and competencies. Plus, even if all of that fails, I’m happy as long as I’m learning something new so I’m pretty sure we’re setup for success here. </p>
        
        <p>A big limitation I am aware of is my ability to focus narrowly on a specific problem for an extended period of time. It has long been a challenge for me, especially in a work context, to remain focused on one task at a time. I am chronic for the ‘magpie’ approch, going for the next shiny task when I’m not quite done with what I’m working on now. I have developed various strategies for managing this in the past – including pretty much every productivty and organisation hack you can think of from pomodoro to bullet journals to to-do apps and everything in between. I think it’s just one of those skills that doesn’t come naturally to me and something I will have to keep working on and managing for the rest of my career. </p>
        
        <p>The other big one which I’m sure will be a challenge for many of us, is asking for help. I don’t tend to sit idle when I’m stuck and when I neglect to ask for help it’s seldom because I’m embarrassed or nervous. More likely, it’s because I’ll get stuck spinning my wheels on something as I try to brute force my way to a solution. Again, I have gotten better at identifying when I’m doing this and asking for help, or taking a break and coming back to the problem fresh. But I know with the intensity of this course, and with the pressure that I’ve heard can be present in dev teams at times, I need to work on getting to the ‘just ask someone” stage a lot sooner. </p>
        
        <p>There are probably more, but these are top of mind for me. I’m confident that I can manage these fairly well, but I expect there could be some workload stress, especially during bootcamp if I fail to manage these effectively. The pressure to do something that I don’t yet understand seldom paralyses me, but time pressure can cause me to shut down a bit. It will be important for me to monitor this and make sure I keep on top of my work to stay calm and focused for the duration of the course.  </p>
        
        <p>Finally, the classic workplace conflict story. I actually have a pretty recent one from just the end of last year at my old job. There’s a guy, let’s call him Phil. Phil has been with the organisation for over three decades and for many years he has been the authority on all things tech and IT. He built the current member database himself and is the sysadmin for the Microsoft 365 subscription, etc etc. He is also responsible for the membership team and their workflows etc in relation to the membership database.</p>
        <p>Part of my role in this organisation was to project manage the build of a new website for the organisation, which was completed at the end of November 2022. The conflict arose around one particular feature which we had included which was a simple calculator for prospective members to calculate what their fees would be, given their income. Now when I say the Phil was resistant to this change, I am probably being generous. Despite the fact that this feature was hotly requested, and very well recieved in testing across the board, he seemed to think it was a bad idea. He witheld important information about subscription rates and different membership scenarios, would refuse to engage in useful dialogue about the feature and continually adopted an attitude of “that’s not right so you shouldn’t have it there at all” rather than working with me to get it right. </p>
        
        <p>Over the course of months, I tried my utmost to get him onside. My usual approach is to essentially ignore the negative and go into customer service mode where the customer is always right. I took on the tiny snippets of information I could glean from the terse emails that Phil would send and reply with a “thanks for your feedback, based on this I’m going to request X, Y and Z changes. Does that sound right?” This generally got no response, until I sent a revised version through, which would then prompt a whole new set of issues which probably could have been mentioned previously. </p>
        
        <p>Eventually, I decided on a more “ask for forgiveness not permission” approach, where I would try and find the information I needed from more willing parties in the organisation and focus on making sure the result work for the members and staff who would actually be using the calculator. This was more effective in getting things moving with the project, but did little to change Phil’s attitude to the whole thing. I suggested in person meetings, reviews with the wider team. Everything I could think of, and it became increasingly clear that this individual wanted no part of bringing this feature to life. </p>
        
        <p>I think on the whole, there is little I could have done differently. When someone wants to fight you and refuses to do their part, there isn’t much that can change their mind. This is especially true when that person is in a more senior position in a very heriarchical organisation. I find it hard to manage this sort of dynamic. As a recovering people pleaser, I kind of just want everyone to like me and when they’re actively antagonistic to my work, I can take it quite personally. </p>
        
        <p>I think that the best thing to do in this sort of situation is fall back on the old adage of “focus on what you can control”. In this case, I was ultimately responsible for delivering a website that would meet the needs of the organisation. That this the metric against which my performance would be measured and that is the goal I had to focus on. I couldn’t let a fruitless pursuit of this individual’s buy in get in the way of that, and I ultimately found that once I got a functional version of this feature on the site with the information  I could gather included, Phil very quickly offered up the changes he wanted to suit his team’s workflow and agenda. </p>
        
        <p>In the end, the job got done. Could it have been easier if we could have collaborated? Absolutely! Would the result have been better? Very possible. Does it really matter in the end? Not really! Everyone got what they needed and I maintained my integrity without getting into a pointless feud and still met my obligations for the project. Sometimes people don’t get a long, and that’s okay. You just have to stay professional, and control what you can control. </p>
