        <span class="blog-subtitle"><p><em>Core Blog Post &#8211; 2 February, 2023</em></p></span>
        <p><strong>There is a saying that I use a lot in my everyday life that guides how I approach challenges: “Action comes before feeling.” Learning more about how the brain works in preparing this blog, I have a new appreciation for just how true that statement really is. More than that, I have identified some things that I have been doing for years which start to explain why I always show up as a “learner” in every personality and strength finders test I’ve ever done. </strong></p>

<p>Dr. Lara Boyd is a Neuroscientest and Physical Therapist at the University of British Columbia, and her research is focused on neuroplasticity, specifically on understanding the way the brain functions in order to help people recover from stroke. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNHBMFCzznE">In her TED Talk from 2015</a>  she talks through the way that the brain processes and stores information, dispelling some common myths about the way the brain works. </p>
<p>This quote in particular stood out to me while I was listening: “Your brain is tremendously plastic, and it’s being shaped both structurally and functionally by everything that you do, but also by everything you don’t do.” The brain, it turns out, is constantly in a state of flux. The ability to learn new information is as natural as the ability to forget it, as our brains work to store only that which is most important to our every day lives. </p>

<p>So if we’re so wired for learning, why can’t we all just pick up a language like those polygots on the internet, or become a world master at a new sport overnight? Dr. Boyd talks about two caveats to the concept of neuroplasticity. First, without sounding too cliched, we have to accept that there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach to learning. We all have greater propoensity for certain tasks which can be linked to physical differences in our brain. Humans who read braile, for example, have been shown to have phsyically larger regions of the brain devoted to interpreting touch senses, and cab drivers in New York tend to have larger regions of the brain for spatial mapping, owing to memorising the city map. </p>

<p>Though structurally, our brain comes pre-loaded with an almost infinite ability to learn, it seems that it is heavily influenced by our experiences, and the things that we have done and will do. As Dr. Boyd puts it, “Nothing is more effective than practice at helping you learn, and the bottom line is that you have to do the work.” So that begs the question of what it actually looks like to  “do the work” and are there ways to increase your individual capcity for learning?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQXMl4GycD0">In his TED Talk from December 2022</a>, Dr. Justin Sung talks about the concept of Higher Order Thinking Skills or ‘HOTS’ which he suggests is the key to unlocking your learning potential. In simple terms, higher order thinking requires you to think about information as connected to other information. He talks about learning as a process of making connections between information – a concept which maps directly against the way that neuroplasticity works. Context, he says, is the key to retaining information. The more time you spend doing the back and forth thinking, making drawing lines between information you already know, experiences you already have, and the new information you want to learn, the better you will remember it. It’s a way of telling you brain “Hey, this is important. Hold onto it for me”. </p>

<p>When we look at these concepts together, we can start to build a picture of what effective learning looks like, but it can start to feel overwhelming very quickly. As Dr. Sung notes, it is a lot more effort to engage in Higher Order Thinking, because you have to actively engage your brain and think about, not only the information itself, but the way that it fits in with the rest of things you know. <a href="https://qbi.uq.edu.au/brain/nature-discovery/how-your-brain-makes-and-uses-energy#:~:text=Your%20brain%20is%20arguably%20the,of%20your%20energy%20each%20day">According to the Queensland Brain Institute</a> your brain accounts for around 20% of your daily energy consumption – so imagine how much more you’re asking of your body, and how tiring it can be, to actively engage your mind to learn something effectively. #legdayforyourbrain.</p>

<p>This is where the efficacy of what is called a “Growth Mindset” starts to make a whole lot of sense. This is the idea that there are two broad categories of learning mindsets: fixed and growth. The fixed mindset knows what it knows, and defines success through results. It revels in a 10/10 or an A+ grade, but shies away from new challenges in pursiut of a perfect record. The growth mindset, on the other hand, seeks out challenges by default and embraces failure as evidence of learning. </p>

<p>This is a very pure dichotomy on paper but nonetheless we can see evidence of this distinction in just about any area we turn our attention to. A homegrown example of these two mindsets in action is the phenomenon of “tall poppy syndrome” as discussed in this episdoe of the aptly named “Business Growth Mindset” podcast. Almost every kiwi must have heard of this at some stage, and if not they’ve likely experienced it. As a culture, we balk at confidence and fester in self-deprecation a lot of the time. There is an unspoken expectation that we water down our experiences and our triumphs, and accept praise meekly, without fanfare or celebration. </p>

<p>On the surface, it would be easy to think that this aligns with the principle of celebrating the process rather than the result, but as the host of the Business Growth Mindset podcast posits, the opposite is true. In fact, this cultural norm is the result of a fixed mindset that has embedded the notion that anyone else’s success throws shadow on our own. Rather than celebrating those who achieve success and feeling content with our own journies, we feel insecure because we are measuring our worth against the fact that we haven’t achieved the same things as someone else. </p>

<p>It’s a confronting proposition, that as a country we’ve essentially cultivated a culture of insecurity and stagnation. There are absolutely valid reasons to resist some of the manifestations of success in modern society, such as auspicious wealth and classism. But it doesn’t feel useful to avoid growth at all costs, for the sake of uniformity. So how can we strike a balance and use what we know about learning and growth to our betterment?</p>

<p>Personally, I like the way that Comedian Drew Lynch puts it, which is to embrace curiosity over ambition. He puts it this way, “The less I’ve thought, the more I’ve done and the more I’ve done the less I’ve cared.” In other words, get out and do things, not because you want to be successful, but because life is more exciting and enjoyable when you actually live it. This is supported by the concepts of neuroplasticity and learning that we discussed earlier. There is no substitute for doing the work when it comes to learning, and the more we can think about what we’re learning, the more it sticks. </p>

<p>That sounds like curiosity to me. Embracing the process, focusing on doing things becuase they’re worth doing, not because there is a payoff in sight. Without having the words to explain it, I have been trying to cultivate this mindset for a while now. The statement I started this blog with “Action comes before feeling” has been a useful starting point to remind me that I need to actually do things if I want to change how things are. But more than that, it’s a reminder to be present in the moment and to be curious. It helps me to focus on seeking enjoyment in the process, rather than telling myself “I’ll be happy when...”</p>

<p>Taking the time to reflect, and process what I’m learning is a key part of this – and something which is baked into the Dev Academy programme too! This stuff is a lifelong journey and I’m exicted to continue this phase of my learning journey at Dev Academy.</p>

        <span class="blog-subtitle"><p><em>Tech Blog Post &#8211; 2 February, 2023</em></p></span>
        <p><strong>A summary of my visit to block city</strong></h3>

<p>You know that feeling when something is so close to working, you know that it’s right there but for whatever reason, you just can’t get it over the line? That’s how I felt with a recent challenge I faced at my old job. I was tasked with setting up a fairly simple automation through Microsoft’s Power Automate. It would take the body of an email, parse it from HTML into plain text and then save that text as a CSV. Simple enough for the most part and it was pretty much working. </p>

<p>But there was a snag. The email in question kept going to my junk folder. This stumped me for a good week. I had setup a folder for these emails to go to and the automation couldn’t work if the files we’re in that folder! </p>

<p>I set about trying to work out how to resolve this issue. I setup various rules in outlook and applied account wide policies to white list the sender domain. I spent hours on Google, trying to find something that I hadn’t tried. I asked for help our website hosting provider, I talked to our IT and sysadmin staff. Between us, we couldn’t work out why this was happening and apply a fix – the emails remained stubbornly in the junk folder, thwarting my automation aspirations. </p>

<p>Then, I got COVID. I was off work for a couple of weeks and the problem went completely out of my mind. When I came back, a bunch of the data that this process was needed for had piled up and I had to find a solution. I jumped back into it, and with fresh eyes immediately found the solution. </p>

<p>I could start the automation from emails that came into my junk folder. Simple. As. That. There was no need to preserve the emails themselves, as the data would be stored in a database at the end of the automation, and it really made no difference which folder the emails came into, as long as the data could be reliably processed. </p>

<p>I spent an entire week focused on the wrong part of the problem. I had created a binary in my mind: the automation works, now we just need to fix the email issue. But in reality, a very easy tweak to the automation made everything work just as required. I learnt the value of taking a step back in this scenario. If something isn’t working, there is usually a reason – and it is an artform to know when to accept that something just isn’t possible. This is something I want to build into my process – to learn where that line is between just trying harder to fix something, and deciding that it isn’t working and to step back and assess what other paths to success might exist. </p>


<p><strong>My most elegant solution ever</strong></p>

<p>One of my biggest ever work ‘wins’ happened in my first job out of university. I was working as a sort of admin support to a sales team, focused on fulfilling customer requests, lots of admin and that sort of thing. </p>

<p>This company sold media intelligence services – essentially helping comms people to keep track of all their relevant industry media, along with mentions of their brands, products, spokespeople and so on. A core part of this was maintaining these files called “briefs” which contained all the key subjects that a client wanted monitored. </p>

<p>Whenever a client wanted to update their keywords, one of the team (usually me) would go into the ancient computer system and manually copy and paste each of these briefs into a word document. We would then use a colour-coding system to keep track of recent changes. Red meant the keywords had been removed from the system, black meant no change and blue meant new keywords to be added. We would manually go through the document deleting red text and changing blue text to black, so that clients could use the same system to provide us with changes to their briefs. </p>

<p>Some clients had just a few keywords in a couple of different briefs which were pretty easy to manage. But some of the bigger ones had hundreds of keywords across tens of different files. They we’re so out of date and unmanageable – one client hadn’t had a full review of their keywords in close to a decade owing because it would have taken a full 40+ hours of work just to get the keywords out of the system. </p>

<p>Well, being the type of person who would rather spend 2 hours automating a task to save 10 minutes, I figured there must be a better way to do this – and I found it. In the customer facing product for this company, there was an export all function for these keyword briefs that spat out a PDF with one brief per page, nicely formatted headings and including the red and blue text. The only problem is that this PDF wasn’t editable without expensive software like Adobe Acrobat – not suitable for most of our clients. </p>

<p>So I did some research and went waaaaay down the rabbit hole of macros and Visual Basic – arguably my first foray into the world of programming. I discovered that I could take what previously took hours of tedious, manual work and reduce it to about 4 clicks of the mouse. By importing the pdf as an object and then using a macro comprised of a series of find and replace commands, I was able to automate 95% of that work and save the company hundreds of hours of time. They were still using it company wide when I left and those large clients had a full review of their keywords for the first time EVER because of this solution. </p>

<p>This really set me up with a mindset of programmatic thinking early in my career – though I didn’t think of it like that at the time. I probably should have realised that I wanted to be a developer much sooner, given the nature of my approach to that entire job, and every other job I’ve had. But either way, I’m here now and I truely believe that experience put me on this path. </p>



<p><strong>Problem solving and me</strong></p>
<p>I love solving problems. It gets me excited and I love the feeling of wrestling with a new challenge as much as I love the rush of getting something to work that you’ve been stuck on for a bit. </p>

<p>I would say that my problem solving methods are very individualistic. For things like googling, trying something, reading error messages, console.logging; I feel super confident and at home working my way through something that’s not working. I’ve always had a bit of a “I can work anything out with enough Googling” kind of attitude to work – and I’ve tested the limits of this multiple times to some slightly chaotic ends. My dog also serves as a faithful rubber duck, sometimes adding the odd whine or bark to put me on the right track.</p>

<p>Where I tend to struggle a bit more is with collaboration. I find it hard to communicate while I’m in the midst of a problem. I’m great at talking about the problem and the solution after the fact – having worked in comms that is kind of the whole gig most of the time. Where I struggle is finding the mental space to articulate what I’m stuck on, and to then interpret and understand the input of my peers who will likely have a different perspective on the problem than me. </p>

<p>I am aware that this is limiting to my ability to find the best outcome. Just because I probably can make something work on my own, doesn’t mean it couldn’t be better or faster or more efficient with the input of multiple people. I try to front foot this interaction by seeking out the opinion of others where I can, and I’m getting better at asking for help. I think my ego gets in the way a bit in these situations, because I don’t really want to let go of control over working something out. I enjoy the puzzle and the solve and I feel like getting the answers from someone else is a bit like getting spoilers – it makes the win feel less. </p>

<p>That’s why I made a commitment to set time limits on working things out myself, so that I have a degree of accountability and can start to build habits that focus on getting the best outcome rather than just hoarding problems because I find them fun. There’s plenty of problem solving to go around and it is super important that I don’t get stuck in a bubble of my own perspective with my work. I’m used to getting feedback on my comms work, so I need to develop that muscle with coding too. </p>
