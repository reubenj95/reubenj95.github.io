        <span class="blog-subtitle"><p><em>Core Blog Post &#8211; 24 January, 2023</em></p></span>
        <p><strong>At the risk of over-simplifying a fairly complex topic, I think that we can boil down the explanation for what makes life satisfying and enjoyable to one essential truth: that if you’re in a state of conflict it is impossible to feel content. This, for me, is at the core of the EQ vs IQ discussion and is how I think about mindfulness in my everyday life. </strong></p>

        <p>According to the Harvard Business Review online, the term EQ or Emotional Intelligence was coined back in 1990 by researchers John Mayer and Peter Salovey. The concept was fairly simple – that effective leaders, both present and future, could be identified by their proficiency in a set of non-technical skills which governed how they related to those they worked with. These skills were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Self-awareness – the ability to understand your own strengths and weaknesses, but also to be aware of your own emotions and the impact these have on those around you. </li>
          <li>Self-management – In simple terms, impulse control. Knowing about your emotions, strengths and weaknesses is one thing, but behaving in a considered and appropriate way even when you’re feeling overwhelmed is a core tenant of an excellent people leader. </li>
          <li>Social awareness – Being able to take that awareness of feelings and interpersonal dynamics and notice those things in others. “Reading the room” in colloquial terms. </li>
          <li>Relationship management – The ability to navigate interpersonal interactions effectively – from coaching and mentoring, to delegation and leadership and conflict management and resolution. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Over the last 30 years, these ideas have become ingrained in popular discourse about what makes a good leader in the workplace. A simple framework that captures these principles which I like to use is the “Wise mind” model. If you think of your mind as having two polar states – the rational mind, which is governed by logic, reason and factual information, and your emotional mind, which is governed by your feelings, your desires and you impulses. </p>
        <p>The intersection of these two opposed states forms your wise mind, which allows you to take the best features of each pole and bring them together. The rational mind has a tendency to overlook the humanity of those you are interacting with, valuing logic and ‘being right’ over all else. Whereas the emotional mind can easily get caught up in a feeling that has no roots in reality and, while that feeling may be totally valid, does not help you to feel better and get stuff done. The more that we can operate in the wise mind, the more that we can tap into that “emotional intelligence” skill set and have better interactions with our colleagues. </p>

        <p>I find this to be a more useful framework when thinking about these types of skills tthan EQ because it avoids the tempation to codify or standardise the emotions and experiences that are unique to every individual. EQ and IQ are often treated as two sides of the same coin, much like the rational and emotional minds. However, there is a tendency to keep them conceptually separate. </p>
        <p>IQ is an objective measure of intelligence against a series of standardised questions. It is a way to create a benchmark and understand where each person sits within the resulting bell-curve, with the smartest at the top and the least smart at the bottom. But how would you expect to find some objective measure of the human experience? How could you ever say that someone was more or less emotionally intelligent than another without having some objective, defensible position on what an averagely emotionally intelligent person is like?</p>
        <p>This is where EQ and IQ diverge. In order for EQ to be a useful metric, it needs to be a practice that one engages in and develops over time and in many different contexts. It demands that we accept that our whole selves exist when we interact with each other, even when we don’t talk about what’s below the surface. It expects empathy and compassion to be woven into our need for excellence and productivity. The semantics of what we call it don’t really matter, but the principle of living in the grey messiness of what we feel and how we react does matter. It is about finding a way to embrace that complexity and use it to our betterment. </p>

        <p>This is why EQ is such an important and pervasive concept in the modern workplace and beyond. Even the most put together, calm, collected person can lose thier cool given the right combination of circumstances. There is a give and take that is inherant in this practice that we all must understand and embrace for it to work properly. Yes, developing the specific skills of mindfulness and social awareness are crucial – but arguably more important is the tone of the whole environment. This starts with those in management, for sure, but it is something that the whole group has to embrace to create a safe and supportive environment from which we can all do great work. </p>
