        <span class="blog-subtitle"><p><em>Core Blog Post &#8211; 9 February, 2023</em></p></span>
        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
<p>First and foremost, I think that I have a much greater appreciation for my capacity for self-reflection. On the one hand, I think this can be a super power – to know yourself and make decisions in a work context which serve you well as a human being. On the other hand, it can be paralysing to get too focused on how you’re feeling, especially when you don’t have the flexibility do what you need to do. I have spent most of my career feeling like I need to separate who I am at work, from who I am full stop. Looking at the core content this week, I can see that I haven’t necessarily been doing myself a favour with this approach. </strong></p>

<p>I think I also noticed that I had some ‘cringe’ to get over at times, and some instincts that I had to resist to properly engage with the core reflections in a meaningful way. I tend to be a bit cynical about anything fluffy or feelings related at work, and only engage at a surface level. In order to do these exercises justice, I had to allow myself to be a bit vulnerable and ‘lean in’, as it were. I wasn’t consciously aware of this resistance in the past, and I think it is something that will be useful for me to have better workplace relationships in the future. </p>

<p>Finally, I had some reservations about my motivation levels, and ability to work hard enough to get the work done on this course. In my second-to-last job, I got super burnt-out. I wasn’t taking care of myself, working crazy hours and not taking breaks. Despite this, I wasn’t getting anything done. Then when I moved to my last job before this course, I took a step back in responsibility and work load, and truthfully I’ve been more or less coasting for the last 12 months. I was really worried that I would struggle with self-motivation, and feel overwhelmed by having so much work to get through. </p>

<p>I actually found myself slipping back into old habits, getting very focused on my work and spending more hours staring at a screen than is perhaps healthy. This was gratifying in a sense, but also is a reminder to me that I need find that balance. I need to trust that I have the drive and focus to get things done, but that I am more useful to myself and my future employer if I can stay rested and healthy. </p>

<br><br><h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
<p>Despite the math, the logic and the structure involved in the act of programming, it is one of the most creative disciplines in our modern world. There are so many ways to solve the same problem and it is innately productive rather than destructive – giving life to new ideas, tools and games that can be birthed from a series of letter, numbers and symbols. </p>

<p>There is no route-learning path to becoming a great developer, and there is no one path that any of us could follow. It is an art form, and like any art form, you need to bring a fair amount of yourself into the process in order for it to be any good. Understanding yourself, knowing how you see the world, your biases and your blind spots: this is how you create software that makes the world better. It also just makes you a nicer person to be around, so that’s always a plus. </p>

<br><br><h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
<p>I was surprised by how hard it was, and how much I grappled with what I wanted to write in these blog posts. I’ve done a bunch of this sort of reflection in a load of different contexts, but I’m realising that the more I learn about myself, the harder it is to be vulnerable. There’s a big difference between talking about your external skills or strengths and your inner motivations and values – which wasn’t what I expected. </p>
<br><br><h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
<p>As alluded to above, the vulnerability was hard work for me. Just finding a way to feel like I was contributing authentically took a whole lot of mental and emotional effort. </p>

<br><br><h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
<p>Can I just say “see answer two”? Nah, but really, I think it’s an essential part of the process and it’s something that should be taught in more educational contexts. </p>

<p>I did an entire four year business, media studies and theatre degree, and the closest we came to any content like this was learning how to give constructive feedback in a script writing paper I took in my final year. It’s not something we learn unless you seek it out, or have a pretty progressive employer. If more places taught these skills, we’d have much more pleasant (and productive) workplaces. So I think it makes a whole lot of sense. Like with most jobs, you don’t need to learn every intricate detail of how to code, and how computers work to be an effective developer. But you do need to be able to work well with others, communicate clearly and produce solutions that help humans, rather than just satisfying criteria. That’s all human skills, and it’s probably harder to learn than any programming language. </p>

<br><br><h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
<p>Absolutely not. The tech content for foundations was a little challenging, but certainly not overwhelming for me. The core content was honestly more of a focus for me in terms of energy and effort and I think it has been a really good experience. </p>

<p>It has also helped me transition back into a learning mindset, ready for bootcamp in a week’s time. It’s a different kind of energy and focus that is required, and I needed to shift from my slightly disengaged mindset at my previous job, to lean in and commit to this experience. If I was just coasting through some coding challenges these five weeks, I think I would have been much less engaged and I would probably flounder a bit in bootcamp. Instead I feel ready and focused, and able to give my full attention to the content as we move on. </p>
